# React

*Making beautiful interfaces*

One of the most loved and wanted web frameworks.

What is it? 

JS Library for building user interfaces. Frontend.

One of the best thigs about is is that it makes everything easy.

You create a single component and customize it.

And end up with a big tree of different components.

It vastly simplifes creating anything. We have different components which are self created HTML elements. It makes code reusable and clean.

All of this achieved by mixing HTML, CSS and JS together in small amounts. Each component has its own functionality and appearance. Twiter is written with React, btw.

It enables apps being very interactive. We have each component updating itself and talking to itself independently. Newsfeed has its own component, posts have their own components, etc.

It's able to rerender components by diffing. When a new info comes, it creates a new version of DOM and spots the difference. And it updates this only component. 

Of course, it is not only front-end framework. But it is the most popular right now. And it is also used everywhere. And it grows quickly. It is very often required by bosses.
