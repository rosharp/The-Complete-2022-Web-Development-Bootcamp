# Encryption

Password + Key => Cipher/Caesar Method => Ciphertext

qwerty + 1 => rvfsuz

To decrypt it you need only shift it down by 1. It is a very weak method, just an example. 

*The code book – Simon Singh*

# Hashing

Password => Hash function => Hash

You don't decrypt a password. You use hash function which is stored in that state. A mathematical equation impossible to go backwards. It is turned in very easily. 

It's like dividing of 377. 

Login, Password => Hash function => Hash => Compare with stored hash. 

**The only person knowing the real password – is user.**


# salting

Takes hashing to the next level. Creates a random set of characters which goes along with a password.

qwerty + 28234085 => hash function = > hash

In order to make security higher, you can use bcrypt.

20,000,000,000 MD5 Hashes/sec
17,000 bcrypt hashes/sec

## Salt Rounds 

The number of times you create new saltes. When you hashing your password, you can set number of rounds to hash password. It depends on power of your machine. 

### Checking

Password + salt + the same number of rounds => compare with hash
